# ü§ù Contributor Guide: Team Development Workflow

**A step-by-step guide to contributing to the Kompass-App project**

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- Git installed and configured with SSH keys
- GitHub account with fork of the main repository
- Node.js and npm installed
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

---

## üîß Initial Setup (One-time)

### 1. Fork & Clone Setup

```bash
# If you haven't forked yet, go to: https://github.com/Pahnini/kompass-app
# Click "Fork" button to create your copy

# Clone your fork (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/kompass-app.git
cd kompass-app

# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream git@github.com:Pahnini/kompass-app.git

# Verify remotes
git remote -v
# Should show:
# origin    git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/kompass-app.git (fetch)
# origin    git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/kompass-app.git (push)
# upstream  git@github.com:Pahnini/kompass-app.git (fetch)
# upstream  git@github.com:Pahnini/kompass-app.git (push)
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
npm run dev
# App should run at http://localhost:5173
```

## üîÑ Daily Workflow

### Step 1: Start Fresh

Always start by getting the latest changes from the main project:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Get latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream changes into your main
git merge upstream/main

# Push updated main to your fork
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Create Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Examples:
# git checkout -b fix/mood-compass-bug
# git checkout -b feature/new-badge-system
# git checkout -b enhancement/improve-ui
```

### Step 3: Make Your Changes

```bash
# Work on your code...
# Edit files, add features, fix bugs

# Check what files you've changed
git status

# See your changes
git diff
```

### Step 4: Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Step 5: Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Add files to staging
git add .

# Or add specific files
git add src/components/NewComponent.tsx

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add new badge system for user achievements"

# Examples of good commit messages:
# "Fix: Correct mood compass animation timing"
# "Feature: Add XP system with visual feedback"
# "Enhancement: Improve mobile responsiveness"
# "Docs: Update installation instructions"
```

### Step 6: Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request
# GitHub will usually show a banner with "Compare & pull request"
```

### Step 7: After PR is Merged

```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Delete the feature branch (local)
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name

# Delete the feature branch (remote)
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name

# Get latest changes (including your merged PR)
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

## üéØ Project-Specific Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new components
- Follow the existing folder structure in `/src`
- Use the established naming conventions
- Add proper TypeScript types

### Testing Your Changes

```bash
# Before committing, always run:
npm run type-check  # Check for TypeScript errors
npm run lint        # Check for code style issues
npm run format      # Auto-format your code
npm run dev         # Test in browser
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `enhancement/description` - Improvements
- `docs/description` - Documentation changes

### Commit Message Format

```
Type: Brief description (50 chars max)

Optional longer description explaining what and why
```

Types: `Feature`, `Fix`, `Enhancement`, `Docs`, `Refactor`, `Test`

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Problem: "Your branch is behind"

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

### Problem: Merge conflicts

```bash
# Edit conflicted files manually
# Remove conflict markers (<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>)
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

### Problem: Accidentally committed to main

```bash
# Create a new branch from current state
git checkout -b feature/my-changes

# Reset main to upstream
git checkout main
git reset --hard upstream/main
```

### Problem: Need to update PR with new changes

```bash
# Make more changes
git add .
git commit -m "Address review feedback"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# PR will automatically update
```
